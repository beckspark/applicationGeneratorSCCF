$fname,

Thank you for your application for assistance. Your application has been approved. The Senior Charity Care Foundation will help you get dental work on a sliding fee scale.

If you need dental work, there is no cost for your initial appointment where you will receive x-rays and an exam. The hourly cost for ongoing appointments will be $$$hourly.

If you do not have enough funds to pay at the time of the clinic, we will send you an invoice and you can pay as you are able afterwards. Even paying $$5 or $$10 per month, helps us to serve more seniors.

However, if you need dentures, we ask that you please pay your portion in full in advance. Your cost would be $$$denture for a single denture or $$$dentures for a full set. A small partial (or flipper of one to three teeth) would cost you $$$flipper. Adding valplast to dentures would cost you $$$valplast.

Please arrive 15 minutes prior to your appointment time to compete a medical history. Also, remember to bring a list of any medications you take.

If you no-show your appointment, keep in mind you may be charged a $$25 no-show fee.

Feel free to reach out to me at (801) 515-0480 if you have any questions or concerns. If I am not at the office, one of my co-workers will gladly take a message for you if you give them my name, and I will get back to you as soon as possible.

Sincerely,
